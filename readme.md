## Development Notes

### File Loading System

As of version 1.0.8, the plugin uses manual file loading for better security and performance:

```php
require_once RBUI_PATH . '/functions/rbui-admin-menu.php';
require_once RBUI_PATH . '/functions/rbui-functions.php'; 
require_once RBUI_PATH . '/functions/rbui-shortcode.php';
require_once RBUI_PATH . '/functions/class-rbui-widget.php';
```

**Benefits of manual loading:**
- Better security (only intended files are loaded)
- No open_basedir restriction issues
- Improved performance (no directory scanning)
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- More predictable behavior

**Adding new functionality files:**
When adding new PHP files to the `functions/` directory, you must manually add a `require_once` statement to the main plugin file.
